# Avoidr
![Avoidr banner](screenshots/banner.png)
Phone game made using the [Corona SDK](https://coronalabs.com/). Code by Elias Kassell Raymond and design by Raimonds Baukerts. This app was previously hosted on the Android Play Store, but has now been taken down.

The latest published build is available in the builds folder.

## Concept
The player has two controls: swipe left or swipe right. These are used to dodge incoming "notes". These notes play a sound when spawned indicating their spawn position, and increase in speed over time.

### Deployment

Open the project folder with Corona SDK, follow typical SDK build steps. Note that the high score system requires a REST style server. When published the game used [Backendless](https://backendless.com/).
